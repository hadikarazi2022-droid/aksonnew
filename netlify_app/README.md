# Akson - AI-Powered Study Companion (Web Version)

This is the web version of Akson, an AI-powered study companion application that helps students learn more effectively using spaced repetition techniques.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Track your study progress and statistics
- **Deck Management**: Create and organize flashcard decks
- **Study Sessions**: Interactive flashcard studying with spaced repetition
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your learning progress over time

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- LocalStorage for data persistence

## Deployment to Netlify

This application is ready for deployment to Netlify:

1. **Drag and drop**: Simply drag the entire folder to Netlify's deploy interface
2. **Git integration**: Connect your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository to Netlify
3. **CLI deployment**: Use the Netlify CLI to deploy

No build step is required since this is a static application.

## How It Works

The application stores all data in the browser's LocalStorage, making it completely client-side. This allows for offline functionality and fast performance without requiring a backend server.

## Browser Compatibility

The application works on all modern browsers that support ES6 JavaScript and LocalStorage.
